# GenericUntitledGame
This is an untitled game in the style of a visual novel doujin game, but with no story as to keep it especially generic.  All imagery was previously generated using AI.

		travel to different locations to collect needed items
		items can unlock hidden items and secret locations

	Viewport:
		displays picture of location
		draws from possible backgrounds based on location type
		
	Location list:
		types of locations to visit
		select one to go to a random location of that type
		some will have items to search for
		
	Menu list:

	Actions list:
		context-based actions
			search, especially
			
	Dialogue box:

    The above are goals and may be trimmed or expanded upon.
    Stretch goals:

    I have some sunrise, sunset, moonlight and nighttime images that I'd like to include, maybe using a clock function.
	I may turn the ellipse into a cabochon that changes colors to cryptically help indicate what to do.
	I may include both good and bad endings.
